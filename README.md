# FishInverAtlas_Ricard
Ricard and Shachell 2013 https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/349264.pdf developed a reproducible report building from previous work and former atlases by 
1) providing a comprehensive suite of indices to assess population status and environmental preferences of 104 species and,
2) archiving code at DFO Maritimes Region. 
In 2020 Dan Ricard and Nancy Shackell shared code with Catalina Gomez to reproduce its outputs. This repo will update code assembled in Ricard and Shachell (2013) using new tools (e.g. mar.wrangling, csasdown) and developments.
